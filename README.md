![Statistical-js](/logo/my_logo.png)

Library that provide you some statistics which are useful and with the best performance execution.

## Getting Started

`npm install --save statistcal-js`
```javascript
/* how to import and use it */
const statistical = require('statistical-js');

const res = statistical.methods.sum([1, 2, 3]);
const p = new statistical.ml.Perceptron({
    learningRate: 0.3,
    bias: 0.5
});
```

### Performance

To provide you with the best performance when using statistical-js, this library has implemented a variable cache system to save the last calculations.
To see how manage it if it necessary, you can go to [perfomance section !](https://github.com/adrien2p/statistical-js/wiki/Performance)
